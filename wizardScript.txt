&You wake up in the middle of a forest. You’re an avid fan of hiking
and often hike around forests, but these trees that look exactly like
every other tree in existence don’t look familiar to you. Leaves and
grass crunch beneath your sneakers as you wander around the forest,
trying to find a way out of this forest and hopefully into a city.
\Instead, you wander into a cave since it was getting very dark out
and you didn’t want to stay outside longer.&

&The cave was dark, damp, and cold. You shiver as you wander deeper
into the cave, which began to grow warmer, and you spotted something
bright. You conclude that the brightness was what was causing the
warmth. And you would be correct, because it is a fire.&
        
&Sitting by the fire was a wizard. They looked like your typical
cartoon wizard, like Merlin or something, with their long, gray beard
that reaches their knees and a purple gown and pointy hat covered in
golden stars.&

&WIZARD: Howdy-ho! I see you’ve ventured into my very cool cave.&

&YOU: Um… yeah, I was just looking for a place to stay. I woke up in the woods.&

&WIZARD: How crazy! Welp. Since you’re in my cave, which is very cool, I have a
little adventure for you to go on. IF you would like to. Except you sorta have 
to, there’s no way around it. Sorry about that.&

&You look at him, confused.&

&YOU: What do you mean there’s no way around it? I’ll just walk back out and find 
somewhere else to stay!&
&WIZARD: Mmmm, except you can’t really leave. In order to go back out you have to 
make a BUNCH of decisions! I can’t tell you what those decisions are, since the scenarios 
you’re given are randomized. And I didn’t choose them! I just live here.&

	&You blink. You feel confused. And pissed off.&

&YOU: But what if I don’t want to go through with it? I think making decisions is 
stupid.&
&WIZARD: Then we’ll just become roommates! :D&
&YOU: Oh…&

	
#	> Option A: No thanks, I’ll do your stupid scenarios
	> Option B: Sure, lets be roommates!
	
	#%
        
^WIZARD: Well, that was easy-peasy! Alrighty then. In each room, you will be faced with 
a scenario, and your choices impact the outcomes. They’re all some sorts of dilemmas, 
blah blah, I don’t know too much about ‘em, I just tell people what’s supposed to happen!^)

@WIZARD: Oh.. You don't want to be roommates? Well, now I'm sad, But ok. Alrighty then. 
In each room, you will be faced with a scenario, and your choices impact the outcomes. They’re 
all some sorts of dilemmas, blah blah, I don’t know too much about ‘em, I just tell people what’s 
supposed to happen!@)

&YOU: Then why are you even here if you don’t know anything about what’s happening?&
&WIZARD: Don’t worry about it! Anyway, there’s a pedestal over there that’s gonna give 
you your first scenario!&

&The Wizard points to the other side of the room where a grey, stone pedestal stands between 
two doors that don’t belong in a cave. They’re like normal house doors, which is really weird. 
On the pedestal is a thick book, flipped open to the middle. There isn’t much written on it except for...&

#"...You are babysitting a pair of twins, who are interested in your stock of candy. You always give them your sweets, 
except today you only have 1 piece of candy. It's hard candy! so... You cannot exactly split it. Both twins want 
this piece of candy, and they are asking you to pick between them for who receives the only candy you have. This 
candy also happens to expire tomorrow. You cannot eat this candy yourself. 

	> Option A: Give the candy to one of the twins. Maybe your favorite? You cannot let the candy go to waste. 
	> Option B: Do not give either twin candy. It is not fair to either of them.

^You've chosen option A. You go through the door labelled 'A.'^*
@You've chosen option B. You go through the door labelled 'B.'@$

&You walk into the next room, which did not have a fire in it. Or a weird Wizard. It did, however, have your BFF in it! And 
also some little trinkets that decorated the room. You approach BFF, and as you think about it more, you’re confused by their 
existence. Why are they here? How are they here?&


	&YOU: BFF? What are you doing here?&
	&BFF: Idk. Just hanging out.&
	
&You see another pedestal. With the same book as before. But instead of approaching it, your BFF speaks up...&
&BFF: Hey, I know the next problem you have to do. It's really easy.&
&YOU: Oh, okay! Lay it on me.&

&BFF takes a long breath.&
&BFF: You're conducting a really really cool choo choo train. It even has a whistle! You look out the front window
things of the train and there's like, a fork in the tracks. You can either go left or right, because it's a train,
you know?&
&YOU: Yep. That's how trains work.&
&BFF: Okay, so. You see there's some people tied to the tracks. On the left side, there's a small child tied there. On
the other side, the right side? 5 smelly old people.&
&YOU: That doesn't sound biased at all.&
&BFF: Of course not. Would you steer the train left or right?&
#YOU: ...Well...

	> Option A: Left. Saving 5 people is better than one. 
	> Option B: Right. A child's life is worth more than people who have already lived full lives.

^You've chosen option A. 
YOU: You save more people that way...

You go through the door labelled 'A.'^$

@You've chosen option B. 
YOU: I can't just watch a kid die.

You go through the door labelled 'B.'@*

&You slip through to the next room. Oddly... It looks just the same. The ceiling is just as high, it feels just as musty, and 
sort of cold. But the most interesting thing is that your BFF was... Right there, in the same place as the last room. 
You tried to turn back to see how they got here so quickly, but... The door was shut up tight.&

&YOU: What the hell... That damn wizard.&
&BFF: Hey. Ready for your next problem?&
&YOU: ... Yeah, I guess.&

&BFF looks excited.&
&BFF: OKAY, so. You have a really sick wife. And I don't mean like, siiiick hot sort of way. I mean like,
soap drama hospital sick.&
&YOU: Uh huh.&
&BFF: She's really sick, right. So you need to get her medicine. Except you live in the United States,
and you know. Big Pharma has the prices upppp. You can't afford it, even when you go see some 
greedy doctor and kiss his boots.&
&YOU: Ew.&
&BFF: Yeah. SO. You have 2 options. Either steal the drugs, which is bad because, y'know. Stealing. 
Or you don't steal and your wife might die. Might. Just might.&
&YOU: How is this fun again?&
&BFF: I was told it's like a BuzzFeed quiz. They don't sponsor this btw!!!&
&YOU: Hate the humor of this already.&
#BFF: So just make a decision. lol

	> Option A: Steal from the greedy doctor. You love your bleeping wife. Maybe doc will learn his lesson.
	> Option B: Don't steal. Stealing is bad, you can get arrested for that.

&You go through your door, and to your amazement, it's like you walked in a circle. You're like, in the same room. Best friend? Right there.&
&BFF: OKAY SO.&
&They get into it before you can even say anything.&
&BFF: There's this drowning kid, right-&
&YOU: Areyou kidding me right now?&
&BFF: And you save the kid, right? You save the kid, and you get all your nice 9-5 clothes wet. But like, the next day,
you see another kid drowning in this same 2-inch pond. But this time you're wearing fuzzy socks and if you get them wet 
it will ruin your day.&
&YOU: are you actually joking right now. I choose between socks or a kid?&
&BFF: Yes. but the next day, It will cost you like 5 grand.&
&YOU: ...Is that what the pedestal even says?&
&BFF: Then the next day, it costs you ten grand. That's like, a down payment on a car!
Is a kid worth that much? Maybe. I mean, yeah. But then the next kid costs you STUDENT LOANS.&
&YOU: oh f&
#BFF: do you want to save a child but have student loans?

	> Option A: yeah if it means saving a kid
	> Option B: oh yeah to the MOUNTAINS with that lol i hate sallie mae

@You've chosen option B. You go through the door labelled 'B.' wow.@*

&You go through that next door. That decision seemed too easy to make. You also start wondering 
about this wizard guy, some more. How many rooms does he have in here? And how many carbon copies
of your BFF can he make?&

&BFF: Hey besfren.&
&YOU: Besfrennnn. What's the scenario?&
&BFF: This is a really good one. SO. A serial killer comes to your door.&
&YOU:&
&YOU: really?&
&BFF: yea. He comes up to your door and he knocks. He knocks really politely.&
&YOU: Now why would I open the door?&
&BFF: You open the door. He is not selling you anything. In fact, he just wants to know 
if your best friend is in the house.&
&YOU: ...oh?&
&BFF: Yes. You can either liiiiie to him, and say your BFF isn't home, or, you choose to not lie.
Because lying is bad, remember?&
&YOU: Is this a serious decision? I think it's pretty obvious...&
#BFF: I hope so!

	> Option A: lie and save your besfren, what do you mean??
	> Option B: Lying Is Bad.

&You go through that door. Whew. These questions are so easy. 
The room...Is pretty much the same. But the wizard is there!&
&There's also some streamers, and balloons. BFF is there. They're eating
some cake.&
&BFF: MMMM. Come see what your result is!&

&YOU: Huh?&
&The wizard is dancing with fuzzy socks on, and he's spinning around with a cake in his hand.&
&WIZARD: YIPEEEEEE! This cake is just for you!&
&You look at the cake. This is... so weird.&

&You step through the door, and you walk in a little further. It's sort of darker, but there's a candle
illuminating the pedestal in front of you.&
&YOU: BFF? You there?&

&there is no answer.&
&There is No Answer&
&You take the candle, and you walk around the cave-ish room. There's no doors where they used to be. And there's an ugly grocery 
store sheet cake laying where your BFF stood through all of those rooms.&
