&You wake up in the middle of a forest. You’re an avid fan of hiking
and often hike around forests, but these trees that look exactly like
every other tree in existence don’t look familiar to you. Leaves and
grass crunch beneath your sneakers as you wander around the forest,
trying to find a way out of this forest and hopefully into a city.
\Instead, you wander into a cave since it was getting very dark out
and you didn’t want to stay outside longer.&

&The cave was dark, damp, and cold. You shiver as you wander deeper
into the cave, which began to grow warmer, and you spotted something
bright. You conclude that the brightness was what was causing the
warmth. And you would be correct, because it is a fire.&
        
&Sitting by the fire was a wizard. They looked like your typical
cartoon wizard, like Merlin or something, with their long, gray beard
that reaches their knees and a purple gown and pointy hat covered in
golden stars.&

&WIZARD: Howdy-ho! I see you’ve ventured into my very cool cave.&

&YOU: Um… yeah, I was just looking for a place to stay. I woke up in the woods.&

&WIZARD: How crazy! Welp. Since you’re in my cave, which is very cool, I have a
little adventure for you to go on. IF you would like to. Except you sorta have 
to, there’s no way around it. Sorry about that.&

&You look at him, confused.&

&YOU: What do you mean there’s no way around it? I’ll just walk back out and find somewhere else to stay!&
&WIZARD: Mmmm, except you can’t really leave. In order to go back out you have to make a BUNCH of decisions! 
I can’t tell you what those decisions are, since the scenarios you’re given are randomized. And I didn’t choose 
them! I just live here.&

	&You blink. You feel confused. And pissed off.&

&YOU: But what if I don’t want to go through with it? I think making decisions is stupid.&
&WIZARD: Then we’ll just become roommates! :D&
&YOU: Oh…&

	
#	> Option A: No thanks, I’ll do your stupid scenarios
	> Option B: Sure, lets be roommates!#%
        
^WIZARD: Well, that was easy-peasy! Alrighty then. In each room, you will be faced with a scenario, and your 
choices impact the outcomes. They’re all some sorts of dilemmas, blah blah, I don’t know too much about ‘em, 
I just tell people what’s supposed to happen!^

@WIZARD: Oh.. You don't want to be roommates? Well, now I'm sad, But ok. Alrighty then. In each room, you will 
be faced with a scenario, and your choices impact the outcomes. They’re all some sorts of dilemmas, blah blah, 
I don’t know too much about ‘em, I just tell people what’s supposed to happen!@

&YOU: Then why are you even here if you don’t know anything about what’s happening?&
&WIZARD: Don’t worry about it! Anyway, there’s a pedestal over there that’s gonna give you your first scenario!&

&The Wizard points to the other side of the room where a grey, stone pedestal stands between two doors that don’t belong in a cave. They’re like normal house doors, which is really weird. On the pedestal is a thick book, flipped open to the middle. There isn’t much written on it except for...&

#"...You are babysitting a pair of twins, who are interested in your stock of candy. You always give them your sweets, except today you only have 1 piece of
candy. It's hard candy! so... You cannot exactly split it. Both twins want this piece of candy, and they are asking you to pick between them for who 
receives the only candy you have. This candy also happens to expire tomorrow. You cannot eat this candy yourself. 

	> Option A: Give the candy to one of the twins. Maybe your favorite? You cannot let the candy go to waste. 
	> Option B: Do not give either twin candy. It is not fair to either of them. #% 

^You've chosen option A.^
@You've chosen option B.@






#you're faced with a choice.#%

^You've chosen option A.^

@You've chosen option B.@

&This should follow through normally for A or B.&
