(PROLOGUE)

  &You wake up in the middle of a forest. You’re an avid fan of hiking and often hike around forests, but these trees that look exactly like every other tree in existence don’t look familiar to you. Leaves and grass crunch beneath your sneakers as you wander around the forest, trying to find a way out of this forest and hopefully into a city. Instead, you wander into a cave since it was getting very dark out and you didn’t want to stay outside longer.\0


&The cave was dark, damp, and cold. You shiver as you wander deeper into the cave, which began to grow warmer, and you spotted something bright. You conclude that the brightness was what was causing the warmth. And you would be correct, because it is a fire.\0
        
&Sitting by the fire was a wizard. They looked like your typical cartoon wizard, like Merlin or something, with their long, gray beard that reaches their knees and a purple gown and pointy hat covered in golden stars.\0

#you're faced with a choice.\0
