(PROLOGUE)

  &You wake up in the middle of a forest. You’re an avid fan of hiking and often hike around forests, but these trees that look exactly like every other tree in existence don’t look familiar to you. Leaves and grass crunch beneath your sneakers as you wander around the forest, trying to find a way out of this forest and hopefully into a city. Instead, you wander into a cave since it was getting very dark out and you didn’t want to stay outside longer. 
	The cave was dark, damp, and cold. You shiver as you wander deeper into the cave, which began to grow warmer, and you spotted something… bright. You conclude that the brightness was what was causing the warmth. And you would be correct, because it is a fire.
	Sitting by the fire was a wizard. They looked like your typical cartoon wizard, like Merlin or something, with their long, gray beard that reaches their knees and a purple gown and pointy hat covered in golden stars.\0

WIZARD: Howdy-ho! I see you’ve ventured into my very cool cave.
YOU: Um… yeah, I was just looking for a place to stay. I woke up in the woods.
WIZARD: How crazy! Welp. Since you’re in my cave, which is very cool, I have a little adventure for you to go on. IF you would like to. Except you sorta have to, there’s no way around it. Sorry about that. 

	You look at him, confused. 

YOU: What do you mean there’s no way around it? I’ll just walk back out and find somewhere else to stay!
WIZARD: Mmmm, except you can’t really leave. In order to go back out you have to make a BUNCH of decisions! I can’t tell you what those decisions are, since the scenarios you’re given are randomized. And I didn’t choose them! I just live here. 

	You blink. You feel confused. And pissed off. 

YOU: But what if I don’t want to go through with it? I think making decisions is stupid.
WIZARD: Then we’ll just become roommates! :D
YOU: Oh…

	OPTION THAT DOES NOT AFFECT ANYTHING!:

	> Option A: No thanks, I’ll do your stupid scenarios
	> Option B: Sure, lets be roommates!

	Option A Dialogue:

WIZARD: Well, that was easy-peasy! Alrighty then. In each room, you will be faced with a scenario, and your choices impact the outcomes. They’re all some sorts of dilemmas, blah blah, I don’t know too much about ‘em, I just tell people what’s supposed to happen! 
YOU: Then why are you even here if you don’t know anything about what’s happening?
WIZARD: Don’t worry about it! Anyway, there’s a pedestal over there that’s gonna give you your first scenario!

	The Wizard points to the other side of the room where a grey, stone pedestal stands between two doors that don’t belong in a cave. They’re like normal house doors, which is really weird. On the pedestal is a thick book, flipped open to the middle. There isn’t much written on it except for;


	> Option A: [Insert Option]
	> Option B: [Insert Option]

	(BFF TIME)

	You walk into the next room, which did not have a fire in it. Or a weird Wizard. It did, however, have your BFF in it! And also some little trinkets that decorated the room. You approach BFF, and as you think about it more, you’re confused by their existence. Why are they here? How are they here?
	
	YOU: BFF? What are you doing here?
	BFF:

	[ I don’t remember what happens in here, so insert some dialogue or something]

	> Option A: [Insert Option]
	> Option B: [Insert Option]
